## What is this?

*Rogue N' Roll* is a strategy game. 
Your mission is to defeat hordes of enemies by matching the rolled number (imagine a D6 dice) to their weakness. 
It can be a value or a range. 
You can also use cards to change the rolled value. It works like a wheel - if you add too much you will get back to the start, (5 + 2 = 1) and if you subtract enough you will go to the end (1 - 1 = 6).
If you miss to attack the enemies (no enemy is hit), they will damage your shield and you die with 0 or less shield.
Each horde will grant you a new level and a passive skill that will mess with your roll. You can't control your passives.

You earn points by enemy killed. The earned point scale with level and amount of enemies killed at once.

## I didn' get it! What should I do?

Hit *"Rolar"* button and see the what number you rolled.
Then hit *"Atacar"* if you have the number you wanted, or select the cards above to change it.
If you hit, you are good to roll again, if not you have to hit "Defender" to defend the enemies attack.
If you are good enough to survive the attack, you can roll again.
Your *Active cards* will reset if you pass the turn without using any and not hiting anyone.

## When does it ends?

When you die or when you shut the browser tab running the game.

## Still didn't get it, what is the best way to play it?

Hit *"Rolar"* button, check the changes to the screen to understand what is going one.
Press the cards and check what happened to the numbers and to the monsters.
Hit *"Atacar"* button, check if something happened.
Explore what you can do and try to figure out how it works.
Discovery is part of the fun.
